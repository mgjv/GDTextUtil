Instead of croak, use $@ to store an error message. Or maybe add an
attribute and method to get at the error.

GD::Text::Wrap and GD::Text::Align

Before drawing, check that the colour is a valid index number

GD::Text::Wrap

Nit:
Make sure that _set_text only gets called once. Add some global that
gets reset when one of the attributes changes. I'm not even sure that
there is that much gain in saving these CPU cycles. It's more a matter
of elegance.

Adapt to use GD::Text object
	Test that a string has been set.
	Check that the font passed in is actually valid.
	Change default value to a builtin?

Document the internal functions.
