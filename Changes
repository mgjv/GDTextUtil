Revision history for Perl extension GDTextUtil.

Thu Jun 19 2003

- Fixed check for TTF font support. The libgd error message changed
  between 1.8 and 2.0
- Release patched version

Thu Feb 20 2003

- Removed cetus.ttf from distribution because of copyright uncertainties
- Fixed font search, slightly

Thu Jun 15 2002

- Fixed GD::Text, use Cwd. For some reason, this was only a problem
  under Perls before 5.6.0.

Sat Jan 19 2002

- Added demo/GDWrap.ref.png
- Changed demo/GDWrap.pl
- Fixes so that set_font always uses absolute path for TTF. This to
  circumvent some bug/misfeature in the freetype 2.0.x library.
- Fixed up tests, to include approximate checking of bounds, instead of
  requiring absolute match.
