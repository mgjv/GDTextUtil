This are Text utilities for use with the GD drawing package. This
package provides three modules:

GD::Text:
	Provides information about a font, irrespective of whether the font
	is a TTF or builtin font.

GD::Text::Align
	Align a string around a coordinate, left, right, center, top, bottom
	or center.

GD::Text::Wrap
	Wrap a long string between a right and left margin, starting at a
	certain y coordinate. Layout the text flush left, flush right,
	center, or justified.

Installation:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make demo
	make install

Todo:

- Search path for TTF fonts.
- Make the interface more flexible
- Alignment for the wrap boxes as a whole
- More documentation
- More demo code
