This are Text utilities for use with the GD drawing package. This
package provides three modules:

GD::Text:
    Provides information about a font, irrespective of whether the font
    is a TTF or builtin font.

GD::Text::Align
    Align a string around a coordinate, left, right, center, top, bottom
    or center.

GD::Text::Wrap
    Wrap a long string between a right and left margin, starting at a
    certain y coordinate. Layout the text flush left, flush right,
    center, or justified.

Requirements:

	perl 5.005_03 or higher, preferably 5.6. It may work on older
	versions, but it has not been tested, and I won't spend a lot of
	time trying to support it.

	GD 1.20 or up, built for TTF (freetype) support.

Installation:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make demo
    make install

Demo(s) can be found in the demo directory.

Todo:

- Make the interface more flexible
- Alignment for the wrap boxes as a whole
- More demo code
